- checkout "JSON" guide on how to parse GUID/UUID
- checkout "Fetch JSON" guide on how to use threads to fetch btc-prices
- add and use scry path based on gid/eid
- remove/kick invitation/member

## Front-end

- make groups link standout from the rest. Different color + go back arrow.
- validate forms on front-end (htmx-validate)

## Considerations

- mobile-first: separate list of groups/members from input forms. Either
    display info or ask for input on one site.
- implement a hamburger menu
