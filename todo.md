- checkout "JSON" guide on how to parse GUID/UUID
- checkout "Fetch JSON" guide on how to use threads to fetch btc-prices
- add and use scry path based on gid/eid
- remove/kick invitation/member
- use knots (name part of the path) in api `?+`
- add property based testing (expenses amount)
- surface pending invites to user
    - (user should klick join for invites without putting in host and gid)


## Front-end

- make groups link standout from the rest. Different color + go back arrow.
- validate forms on front-end (htmx-validate)
- minify mustache.js
- use hx-on to issue validation and modifying users input before requestS

## Misc

- Use peru to manage depedencies such as htmx and mustache

## Considerations

- mobile-first: separate list of groups/members from input forms. Either
    display info or ask for input on one site.
- implement a hamburger menu
